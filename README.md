# Patrick McElhaney's Coding Exercise

(The README was written before the first line of code, so these instructions probably don't work yet.)

## Installation

You should have NodeJS installed.

```sh
npm install
```

To run the tests:

```sh
npm test
```

## Usage

Call bigram and pass it a text file.

```sh
bigram message.txt
```

Or pipe a stream into STDIN

```
echo "The quick brown fox and the quick blue hare."
```
