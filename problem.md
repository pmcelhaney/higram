# The Bigram Parsing Problem

## Task

Create an application that can take as input any text file and output a histogram of the bigrams
in the text.

## Description
A bigram is any two adjacent words in the text. A histogram is the count of how many times that
particular bigram occurred in the text.

A well formed submission will be runnable from command line and have accompanying unit
tests for the bigram parsing and counting code. You may do this in any language you wish and
use any framework or data structures you wish to handle reading the files, building up the
output, and running the unit tests. However the bigram parsing and counting code must be
implemented by yourself.

## Example
Given the text: “The quick brown fox and the quick blue hare.” The bigrams with their counts
would be.

```txt
“the quick” 2
“quick brown” 1
“brown fox” 1
“fox and” 1
“and the” 1
“quick blue” 1
“blue hare” 1
```
